##### Design Pattern Implementations In C#

This projects contains all design patterns implemented in C# 8
`This is an update of the old/legacy project [removed]`

##### Keys to understand this projects and get most benefits
* you should familiar with advanced and most recent c# features
    * you may need some C++/17 knowledge in some patterns implementations
* You should read at least one book about design pattern and solid principles
* You must read the source code in order way
    * For Patterns we will explains the order below
    * For patterns implementations every files should start with {C}\_\[N\]\_description
        * You must track this order :
        * For example : `A_1_VectorRasterNoCaching.cs` comes before `A_2_VectorRasterWithCaching.cs` in adapter pattern
* Every Pattern Directory should have *.md file to describe that pattern `Not Completed Yet`
    
    
#### Order
    
* Solid Principles : `may not contains any implementation`
    * SingleResponsibility
    * OpenClosed
    * LiskovSubstitution
    * InterfaceSegregation

* Creational Patterns
    * Builder
    * Factories
    * Prototype
    * Singleton
* Structural Patterns
    * Adapter
    * Bridge
    * Composite
    * Decorator
    * Facade
    * FlyWight
    * Proxy
* Behavioural Patterns
    * Chain Of Responsibility
    * Command
    * Interpreter
    * Iterator
    * Mediator
    * Memento
    * Null Object
    * Observer
    * State
    * Strategy
    * Template Method
    * Visitor
    
#### Since this project is a replacement of the old project this not completed yet, so you may found shortage in description
with some not-completed examples, but i think by `15 of feb 2020` the update will be completed
   
#### Also notice , C++ Design patterns repository also removed , until i update it to C++ 20 i will not publish it , may published by `may 2020`
