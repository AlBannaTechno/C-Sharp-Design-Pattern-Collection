### facade (façade)

##### Design Pattern : Provides simple/easy way to understand user interface/API Over the large and sophisticated body of code

##### So we can say, facade is providing nice api to consumer/end-user to use without aware about internal details
* It's not an encapsulation , it's an abstraction layer about/above the api
* We can also expose some of internal system to consumers as an optional power
    * but remember with great powers comes great responsibilities
        * so this may leads to un-expected behaviour
        

* Also Notice: since facade explanation/demonstration depends on the problem we solve
and need a complex API to show the real needs of it , we will not implement it here
and i will delegate its implementation to another project, after i create it i will mention the link here

* For now the most common example of facade is Console.WriteLine() method in C# , you can track it in .net core source code 
or de-assembled version of .net framework
